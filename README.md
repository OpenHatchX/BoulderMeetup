OpenHatch X: Boulder
=============

This is a meetup group designed to break down the barriers for people to contribute to open source projects. Many 
people would like to contribute, but they're not sure how. We will be taking a very hands-on approach with pair
programming and open direction. This group is open to developers of all skill levels.

Needs
-----

We're still in the planning stages of the first meetup group. To make this work we still need:
 * A venue
 * Refreshment sponsor
 * Giveaway??

Agenda
------

All times are in minutes from start time. Start time will be 6:30-7pm or so

 * 0-15m Arival. Devs are met with a list of potential projects that they can work on for the night. They may choose
    one from the list or add their own to the list. We also encourage groups to cluster around projects, so talk to
    others to try convincing people to join their project.
 * 15-30m Formal introduction to OpenHatch X. Make sure everyone has something to work on, someone talks for a bit 
    about some aspect of OSS or how to get involved.
 * 30-90m Pair/group programming to fix a bug, add a feature, etc.
 * 90-120m Start closing. Make sure people know what they're doing and encourage them to continue after the meetup.
