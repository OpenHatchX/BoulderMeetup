Prospective Projects
====================

This is supposed to be a list of projects that we can work on. In order to put them in the list,
it would be good to verify that (a) there is a clearly labeled license and (b) the maintainer will
be responsive to questions and pull requests. Try to pick out specific issues that are ripe to be
worked on.
